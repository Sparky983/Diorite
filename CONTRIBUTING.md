# Contributing to Diorite

Before making any major changes to Diorite, please open an issue to discuss the changes. This will 
allow us to discuss the changes and make sure that your PR won't be immediately closed.

## Style

Please use IntelliJ to format your code. The configuration has already been made.

## Testing

Tests are not required since I don't believe they will be valuable in this project. However, if you
want to add tests, for not protocol related code, you can do so.
